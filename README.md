# SQLytics Sales Dashboard ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

An interactive and dynamic sales dashboard built using **Python, MySQL, and Excel**. Designed to extract insights from Superstore data using **SQL queries**, **Power Pivot**, **Pivot Tables**, **KPIs**, and **interactive charts** â€” all integrated through an ODBC connection for a seamless, real-time analytics experience.

---

## ðŸ§© 1. Project Workflow Overview

This project follows a proper **ETL pipeline** using three major tools:

- **Python (Pandas)**: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and splitting the main dataset into three relational tables (`customers.csv`, `products.csv`, `orders.csv`).
- **MySQL Workbench**: Cleaned datasets were imported as SQL tables, and powerful queries were executed to derive business insights.
- **Excel (via ODBC connection)**: Data was pulled dynamically from MySQL into Excel using Power Pivot. KPIs, Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts were used to build the final interactive dashboard.

---

## ðŸ§¹ 2. Data Cleaning (in Python)

- Removed duplicates and empty rows.
- Handled missing values.
- Created a unique `customer_id` for each customer.
- Split the master dataset into:
  - `customers` â€“ name, segment, region, etc.
  - `products` â€“ product name, category, sub-category.
  - `orders` â€“ order ID, dates, quantity, sales, discount, profit, shipping cost.

---

## ðŸ’¾ 3. SQL Database & Queries

After importing data into MySQL Workbench, the following queries were executed to extract meaningful insights:

- **Order with Shipping Delay > 5 Days** â€“ Calculated using `DATEDIFF(ship_date, order_date)`.
- **Percentage of Total Sales** â€“ Customer-wise or product-wise share of total sales.
- **Profit by Region** â€“ `SUM(profit)` grouped by region.
- **Rank Customers by Total Sales** â€“ Used `RANK()` window function.
- **Running Total Sales by Year** â€“ Used window function for cumulative sales trend.
- **Sales by Order Priority** â€“ Grouped by order priority.
- **Sales by Sub-Category** â€“ Insight into performance by sub-category.
- **Top 10 Customers by Total Sales**
- **Top 10 Products by Total Sales**
- **KPIs**: Total sales, quantity, profit for dashboard blocks.
- **Yearly Sales Trend Analysis**

> âœ… All queries were tested and saved for reference.
